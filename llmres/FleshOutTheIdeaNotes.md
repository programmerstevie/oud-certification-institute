## 🧩 Step 1 — Write the “System Paper”

You want a single document that explains:

1. **The Problem:** Trust collapse in the oud market (no proof of authenticity).
2. **The Solution:** An *Oud Certification Institute (OCI)* modeled after gem certification.
3. **Core Mechanism:**

   * GC-MS and FTIR testing.
   * Public registry with unique OCI IDs.
   * Tamper-evident vials and digital fingerprints.
   * Tiered certification (Gold/Silver/Bronze).
4. **Benefits:** Raises market value, preserves ethics, builds international credibility.
5. **Pilot Path:** small lab + trusted collectors + 50 oils.

**Do it like a white paper.** 3–5 pages, clean diagrams, short and factual.
You can write this in Google Docs or Markdown — I can help structure it line by line.

## 🔬 Step 2 — Build the “Minimal Viable Protocol”

You don’t need a lab to *specify* one. Define the **testing procedure on paper**:

* How samples are logged, photographed, and sealed.
* What instruments (GC-MS, FTIR) would be used and what metrics they check.
* How “match percentage” or “purity grade” is decided.
* How data is hashed and stored (for digital fingerprints).

You can base this on publicly available GC-MS reports for agarwood (published in journals).
Once you have the procedure, you can later partner with an existing lab — universities in Indonesia already have GC-MS machines.

## 🧠 Step 3 — Map the Stakeholders

Make a list of:

* 3–5 **small distillers** (Indonesia, Malaysia, India)
* 3–5 **respected collectors/reviewers**
* 1–2 **local university chemistry labs**
* 1–2 **Islamic scholars or ethical trade advisors**

This becomes your *advisory circle*.
Write their names with placeholders for now — it will guide your outreach later.

## 🧰 Step 4 — Create the Data Model

Without a single dollar, you can **design**:

* OCI ID format (e.g., OCI-2025-####)
* JSON schema for reports
* Example registry page (sample front-end layout)
* Mock QR verification flow

You can prototype all of this in a free GitHub repo with static JSON files and sample reports.
It will make your idea *real* to potential partners.

## 🤝 Step 5 — Build Credibility Slowly

When people see you’ve thought through:

* science
* governance
* legal
* economics
  they start to take it seriously.
  Your job now is *depth*, not money.

You can post the paper and mock system to Reddit’s r/Oud, or DM niche collectors for feedback.
Even a few voices saying “this would change everything” gives you traction to approach a real lab later.

## 🪜 Step 6 — Future On-Ramp (once the plan is mature)

Once you’ve got the paper + prototype:

* **Phase 1:** Partner with one university lab for real GC-MS tests. (They’ll often do it free for research.)
* **Phase 2:** Certify your first 20–50 oils.
* **Phase 3:** Publish public registry.
* **Phase 4:** Offer testing to outside sellers.

You’ll go from *concept* → *protocol* → *pilot* → *industry standard*.
