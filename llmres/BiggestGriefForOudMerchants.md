If you’re an **outsider looking in**, the thing that gives most oud sellers the most *grief* isn’t distillation, sourcing, or even shipping.
It’s **trust.**

Let me unpack that carefully, because it sits on top of several interlocking pains:

---

### ⚖️ 1. **Building and Maintaining Trust**

This is the number one headache.
Everyone claims their oud is:

* “wild”
* “pure”
* “aged five years”
* “from a 70-year-old tree in Assam.”

But very few can *prove* it.

Buyers—especially serious collectors—have been burned so many times that they treat every new seller as a probable liar.
Even if your oil is authentic, they’ll question:

* whether it’s cut with synthetics or carrier oils,
* whether the “origin story” is true,
* whether it was really distilled by the people you said.

You can have perfect product and still lose sales simply because **people don’t believe you yet.**
Reputation is everything, and it takes *years* to earn.
A single inconsistency (different smell, reused bottle, vague sourcing) can ruin it overnight.

### 💸 2. **Cash Flow and Capital Strain**

Even veteran sellers lose sleep over this.
Oud is expensive to buy, slow to sell, and the customers often want 0.3g “samples.”
You might tie up thousands of dollars in inventory that doesn’t move for months.
And when you finally sell, your profit might vanish in:

* PayPal fees,
* international shipping,
* broken bottles,
* or refunds from picky buyers who “expected something more barny.”

You need cash reserves and patience; most beginners underestimate this.

### 🌳 3. **Supply and Consistency**

Even big names have trouble sourcing consistent, legal, high-grade wood.
Forests change, local politics change, distillers switch equipment, humidity varies — all affecting aroma.
The same “Kalimantan” batch might smell nothing like last year’s.
That drives sellers crazy, because repeat buyers want “the same bottle as before.”

---

### 🚫 4. **Legal and Shipping Restrictions**

CITES regulations, customs seizures, confiscations — these make shipping oud wood or oil internationally a nightmare.
Even experienced exporters lose packages worth thousands.
Sometimes, to stay legal, they have to under-declare or use local couriers in risky ways — which adds stress and moral conflict.

---

### 💬 5. **Customer Education and Expectations**

Beginners expect oud to smell like Dior’s “Oud Ispahan.”
When they smell real Hindi, they accuse the seller of selling “rotten wood oil.”
Educating each customer takes time and diplomacy.
If you don’t, word spreads fast that your oils “smell weird.”

### 🔥 So what actually *breaks* most sellers?

It’s **the emotional toll of constantly having to prove yourself** to skeptical customers, unreliable suppliers, and border officials — all while juggling cash tied up in slow-moving stock.

If you want a blunt summary:

> The hardest part of selling oud isn’t sourcing or blending it.
> It’s *earning belief* in a marketplace built on doubt.
