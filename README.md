### Title:
The Oud Certification Institute (OCI): A Framework for Verifiable Authenticity and Ethical Trade in Natural Oud Oils and Agarwood

### Author:
Steven N. Santos (Proposer & Originator)
Date of Publication: October 31, 2025

## Abstract:

The Oud Certification Institute (OCI) proposes an independent, verifiable framework for authenticating natural oud oils and agarwood materials.
The purpose of this system is to restore transparency, trust, and ethical integrity in the global oud market by combining chemical verification, provenance documentation, and community-based sensory evaluation.

The OCI model draws inspiration from gemological certification (GIA, SSEF) and agricultural traceability systems but adapts them to the unique sensory and cultural realities of the oud world.
This document serves as the conceptual foundation and technical outline for a future open-standard certification protocol that can be implemented collaboratively across laboratories, traders, and collectors.
